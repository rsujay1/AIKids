* [Andrew Ng Free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN)- The full course is also available in youtube for free but if you want certification, you can go with coursera
* [Applied AI](https://www.appliedaicourse.com/) - Gives a very good hands-on experience on Machine Learning. This is a paid course on yearly subscription
* [Artificial Intelligence A-Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN), [Deep Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/?course_id=1151632) - to get hands-on, you can go with these two udemy courses. But they don't give a detailed explanation.




## Data sets & Designed models
